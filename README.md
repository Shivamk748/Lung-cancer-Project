This repository contains a machine learning-based lung cancer prediction model deployed 
using **Streamlit**. The application provides an interactive interface for predicting the 
likelihood of lung cancer based on patient data.  

## Features  
- Predicts lung cancer likelihood using patient input data.  
- Built with a trained machine learning model.  
- Deployed using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface.  

## Model Details  
- **Algorithm**: [Logistic Regression, SVM,Decision Tree, Random Forest].  
- **Dataset**: Trained on [Dataset Name Lung Cancer Dataset from Kaggle].  
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction.  


## Usage  
- Open the application in your browser.  
- Input patient details into the form.  
- Get prediction results instantly.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Streamlit**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Pandas**  

## Results  
- **Accuracy**: [0.97].  
- **Evaluation**: [confusion matrix ,ROC curve].  

## Future Enhancements  
- Cloud deployment (streamlit).  
- Mobile-friendly interface.  

# How to use the app
